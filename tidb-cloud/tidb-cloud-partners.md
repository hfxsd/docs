# TiDB Cloud Partners

The TiDB Cloud Partner programs aim to establish and foster a strong partnership between PingCAP and our partners to benefit our customers. 

There are two types of partners:

- AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)
- Managed Service Provider (MSP)

## AWS Channel Partner Private Offer

[AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/cpprivateoffers) enables customers to purchase TiDB Cloud in AWS Marketplace, directly from Channel Partners, helping customers to leverage a Channel Partner who has knowledge of their business, localized support, and expertise, and receive the same fast and friction-free purchase experience they are accustomed to in AWS Marketplace.

## Managed Service Provider

A managed service provider (MSP) is a partner who resells TiDB Cloud and provides value-added services, including but not limited to TiDB Cloud organization management, billing services, and technical support.

Benefits of becoming a managed service provider include:

- Discounts and incentive programs
- Enablement training
