# TiDB Cloud Partners

The TiDB Cloud Partner programs aim to establish and foster a strong partnership between PingCAP and our partners to benefit our customers. 

There are two types of TiDB Cloud partners:

- AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)
- Managed Service Provider (MSP)

## AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)

[AWS CPPO](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/cpprivateoffers) enables customers to purchase TiDB Cloud in AWS Marketplace, directly from channel partners, helping customers to leverage a channel partner who has knowledge of their business, localized support, and expertise, and receive the same fast and friction-free purchase experience that they are accustomed to in AWS Marketplace.
