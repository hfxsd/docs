# AWS Channel Partner Private Offer Customer

An AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) customer is a customer who subscribles the TiDB Cloud services in AWS Marketplace directly from Channel Partner. 

Compared to the direct TiDB Cloud customer, the AWS CPPO customer pays invoices through AWS Marketplace, instead of paying directly to PingCAP.

Other daily operations on the TiDB Cloud console are the same for both direct TiDB Cloud customers and AWS CPPO customers.

This document describes how to check history and future bills.

## Check your future bills

Once you successfully become an AWS CPPO customer, you will pay invoices through AWS Marketplace. 

## Check your history bills

If you have migrated from a direct TiDB Cloud account to an AWS CPPO customer account, you can view your history bills prior to the migration by visiting **Billing** > **Bills** > **History** in the TiDB Cloud console.
