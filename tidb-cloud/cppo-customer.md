# AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) Customer

An AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO) customer subscribes to TiDB Cloud services through a Channel Partner in the AWS Marketplace.

Unlike direct TiDB Cloud customers, AWS CPPO customers pay invoices via the AWS Marketplace rather than directly to PingCAP. However, all other daily operations in the TiDB Cloud console remain the same for both AWS CPPO and direct TiDB Cloud customers.

This document outlines how to check both future and historical bills.

## Migrate from a direct TiDB Cloud account to an AWS CPPO customer account

> **Tip:**
>
> Direct customers are the end customers who purchase TiDB Cloud and pay invoices directly from PingCAP.

If you are currently a direct customer with a TiDB Cloud account, you can ask your AWS CPPO to migrate your account to an AWS CPPO customer account.

The migration will take effect on the 1st of a future month. Discuss with your AWS CPPO partner to determine the specific effective date.

On the effective day of migration, you will receive an email notification.

## View your future bills

As an AWS CPPO customer, your invoices will be processed and paid through the AWS Marketplace.

## View your history bills

If you have migrated from a direct TiDB Cloud account to an AWS CPPO account, you can still access your billing history before the migration. To do so, go to **Billing** > **Bills** > **History** in the TiDB Cloud console.
