The meanings of the columns in the `RUNAWAY_WATCHES` table are as follows:

- ID: the ID of the identification item.
- RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: the name of the resource group.
- START_TIME: the start time.
- END_TIME: the end time. `UNLIMITED` means that the identification item is valid forever.
- WATCH: the type of the fast identification. The values are as follows:
    - `Plan` indicates that the Plan Digest is matched. In this case, the `WATCH_TEXT` column shows the Plan Digest.
    - `Similar` indicates that the SQL Digest is matched. In this case, the `WATCH_TEXT` column shows the SQL Digest.
    - `Exact` indicates that the SQL text is matched. In this case, the `WATCH_TEXT` column shows the SQL text.
- `SOURCE` indicates the source of the identification item. If it is identified by the `QUERY_LIMIT` rule, the identified TiDB IP address is displayed. If it is manually added, `manual` is displayed.
- `ACTION` indicates the corresponding operation after the identification. If it is `NoneAction`, the `ACTION` configured in `QUERY_LIMIT` in the resource group is used.
